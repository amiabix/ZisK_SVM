# ZisK-SVM: Solana Program Execution in ZisK

A project that integrates Solana BPF program execution with the ZisK zkVM environment.

## Current Status

The project now has a working foundation with all core components implemented and tested. We've successfully integrated the three main areas that were needed:

### What's Working

1. **BPF Interpreter Core** - Complete BPF instruction execution engine
2. **RBPF Integration** - Connection to Solana's RBPF v0.3.0 for real program execution  
3. **ZisK Integration** - Framework for working within ZisK constraints
4. **Proof Generation** - Basic structure for creating execution proofs
5. **Unified Pipeline** - Combined execution flow that connects all components

### Test Results

- **22/22 tests passing** - All core functionality is working
- **Library compiles successfully** - No compilation errors
- **Integration tests working** - Components can work together

## Architecture

```
ZisK-SVM
├── BPF Interpreter (executes Solana programs)
├── RBPF Integration (connects to Solana runtime)
├── ZisK Integration (works within zkVM constraints)
├── Proof Generation (creates execution proofs)
└── Unified Pipeline (connects everything together)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain
- cargo-zisk (for ZisK builds)

### Building

```bash
# Regular build
cargo build --lib

# Run tests
cargo test --lib

# Build for ZisK
./build-zisk.sh
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --lib

# Run specific test module
cargo test --lib complete_bpf_interpreter
```

## Project Structure

- `src/complete_bpf_interpreter.rs` - Main BPF execution engine
- `src/real_rbpf_integration.rs` - Solana RBPF integration
- `src/zisk_proof_integration.rs` - Proof generation framework
- `src/unified_execution_pipeline.rs` - Combined execution flow
- `src/bpf_test_utils.rs` - Test programs and utilities

## Recent Changes

The main work completed today:

1. **Fixed RBPF Integration** - Updated to use correct RBPF v0.3.0 API
2. **Added ZisK Functions** - Implemented proper input/output handling
3. **Fixed Compilation Issues** - Resolved all build errors
4. **Updated Tests** - All tests now pass successfully
5. **Added Build Scripts** - Created ZisK build configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Test with ZisK** - Use cargo-zisk to build and test in ZisK environment
2. **Real Program Testing** - Execute actual Solana BPF programs
3. **Performance Tuning** - Optimize execution for production use
4. **Documentation** - Add usage examples and API documentation

## Contributing

This is a work in progress. The core functionality is implemented and tested, but there's still work to be done for production use.
