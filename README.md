# Solana Virtual Machine with ZisK Integration

## üöß **UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NOT PRODUCTION READY** üöß

**Current Status**: This project is in early development. Many features described below are planned but not yet implemented. The codebase compiles but has significant missing functionality.

---

## Overview

This project aims to implement a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integrated with the ZisK zero-knowledge virtual machine for generating cryptographic proofs of transaction execution. 

**Note**: This is a work-in-progress implementation. The current codebase provides the foundation but lacks complete BPF execution and ZisK integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED (Working)**
- Basic project structure and compilation
- Solana transaction parsing from JSON/binary formats
- Account data structures and basic state management
- Memory management framework for ZisK constraints
- Basic error handling and logging infrastructure

### üöß **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Incomplete)**
- BPF program loading (basic structure exists, execution is simulated)
- ZisK context bridge (framework exists, real integration missing)
- Transaction execution pipeline (parsing works, execution is simulated)

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED (Planned)**
- Real Solana RBPF integration for BPF program execution
- Actual ZisK zkVM integration and proof generation
- Real compute unit tracking and accounting
- Complete syscall handling for Solana programs
- Proof generation and verification

---

## Architecture (Planned)

The system is designed around a layered architecture that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration between components:

- **Data Layer**: RPC integration for fetching live Solana blockchain data
- **Parsing Layer**: Transaction and account data parsing from multiple formats  
- **Execution Layer**: BPF program execution using Solana RBPF
- **ZisK Integration Layer**: Memory management and proof generation within ZisK constraints
- **Output Layer**: Proof generation and verification data

---

## Core Components

### Main Entry Point (`src/main.rs`)

The ZisK entry point that orchestrates the entire execution pipeline. This file implements the `#![no_main]` attribute required by ZisK.

**Current Status**: Basic structure exists, but ZisK integration is not yet implemented.

### Solana Execution Environment (`src/solana_executor.rs`)

The core SVM implementation that manages account state and handles transaction processing.

**Current Status**: Transaction parsing works, but BPF execution is simulated.

**Key Features (Implemented)**:
- Account state management with Solana account structures
- Transaction parsing from multiple formats (binary, base64, JSON)
- Ed25519 signature verification using ed25519-dalek

**Key Features (Planned)**:
- Real BPF program execution using Solana RBPF
- Complete compute unit tracking and limits

### BPF Interpreter (`src/bpf_interpreter.rs`)

Implements the Berkeley Packet Filter instruction set and execution context for Solana programs.

**Current Status**: Basic structure exists, but instruction execution is not fully implemented.

**Planned Features**:
- Complete BPF instruction set implementation
- Memory region management (heap, stack, account data)
- Instruction execution context and state

### Real BPF Loader (`src/real_bpf_loader.rs`)

Manages loading and execution of BPF programs from Solana mainnet.

**Current Status**: Basic program loading structure exists, but execution is simulated.

**Planned Features**:
- Real BPF program loading from binary data
- Program execution with proper memory context
- Account data conversion between formats

### ZisK Integration (`src/zisk_rbpf_bridge.rs`)

The critical bridge module that manages execution context when running SVM within ZisK constraints.

**Current Status**: Framework exists, but real ZisK integration is not implemented.

**Planned Features**:
- Memory layout optimization for ZisK constraints
- Cycle counting and proof generation state
- Interface between SVM execution and ZisK proof generation

---

## Build System

### Build Script (`build.rs`)

The build script generates ZisK input files from real Solana transaction data.

**Current Status**: Fetches real transaction data from Solana mainnet and generates basic input files.

**Generated Files**:
- `build/input.bin`: Binary input data for ZisK execution
- `build/proof_request.json`: Proof request metadata

## Current Limitations

1. **BPF Execution**: Currently simulated, not real execution
2. **ZisK Integration**: Framework exists but real integration missing
3. **Performance**: No real performance data available
4. **Testing**: Limited test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Many features documented but not implemented

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Solana CLI tools
- Access to Solana RPC endpoint

### Building
```bash
cargo build
```

**Note**: The project compiles but many features are not yet functional.

### Running
```bash
cargo run
```

**Note**: This will generate input files but actual execution is simulated.

## Contributing

This project is actively under development. Contributions are welcome, but please note:

1. **Check current implementation status** before working on features
2. **Focus on core functionality** before adding new features
3. **Test thoroughly** - many components are incomplete
4. **Update documentation** to reflect actual implementation
